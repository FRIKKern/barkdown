# Visual health

Approved fixture captures of the real Electron UI. No live provider, Paper-server save, migration or sync proof is implied. See [rules](RULES.md), [coverage](coverage.json) and the [review report](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/README.md).

Reviewed by Codex. C058 source 72d8f64: actually inspected all 40 candidate stills, 40 difference images and 40 decoded fixture GIF frames; all comparisons unchanged with stable geometry. Also inspected all five live Paper stills and all 37 decoded live GIF frames. Native ownership proof separately reviewed 11 stills and 58 decoded frames. Existing fixture modal-shadow palette banding remains; fixture tours do not prove live provider motion. Title changes explicitly refuse because no guarded title endpoint is supported.

Source commit: 72d8f64c049ab59b42451ea665c80f3b69b38aca; platform: win32; Electron: 38.8.6. Source fingerprints, including dirty capture inputs, are recorded in the manifest.

## [workspace](workspace/README.md)

![Real desktop navigation with disposable local notes; no cloud or provider.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/workspace.gif)

## [chat](chat/README.md)

![Shared main composer: draft, provider chooser and model chooser. No message is sent.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/chat.gif)

## [side-chat](side-chat/README.md)

![A real saved side conversation and its independent composer, using disposable fixture state.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/side-chat.gif)

## [documents](documents/README.md)

![Legacy local document editor, still retained until P2 migration. This is not the Barkpark Paper canvas.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/documents.gif)

## [settings](settings/README.md)

![Real Settings navigation. No server connection or credential is configured.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/settings.gif)

## [goals](goals/README.md)

![Goal component with explicitly injected fixture snapshots and providers blocked. Saved worker chats use the ordinary composer; this is not live scheduler/provider proof.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/goals.gif)

## [profiles](profiles/README.md)

![Profile Settings controls with injected stable registry names. This tour makes no profile switch; real switching and Paper save protection have separate integration evidence.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/profiles.gif)

## [adoption](adoption/README.md)

![Real recovery window with explicit fixture states; no migration is performed in this visual tour. Actual transaction/restart proof is separate.](runs/2026-09-24T07-38-20-900Z/adoption.gif)

## Dedicated journeys and remaining limits

The [Paper editor gallery](../images/status/manifest.json) records its own live server provenance. Dedicated journeys below retain their original source and review; this fixture approval does not restamp them or prove their remaining acceptance criteria.
