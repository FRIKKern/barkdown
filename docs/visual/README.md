# Visual health

Approved fixture captures of the real Electron UI. No live provider, Paper-server save, migration or sync proof is implied. See [rules](RULES.md), [coverage](coverage.json) and the [review report](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/README.md).

Reviewed by Codex. Inspected all 40 source stills and all 40 decoded frames across eight fixture GIFs, including menus, focus, themes, narrow layouts, goal states and adoption recovery. Comparison shows zero changed pixels or geometry differences. Controls remain reachable; fixture GIF palette banding around blurred modal shadows remains an encoding limitation visible in prior evidence, not a layout change. Separately reviewed five live Paper stills and 37 live GIF frames, plus migration 16 stills, 55 editing GIF frames and eight restart samples. Full desktop tests, ten-case native migration with Shift+Enter and saved Undo, and Linux parity run 35929675673 pass. Fixture tours do not prove live saves; those are covered by the private runtime tests.

## [workspace](workspace/README.md)

![Real desktop navigation with disposable local notes; no cloud or provider.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/workspace.gif)

## [chat](chat/README.md)

![Shared main composer: draft, provider chooser and model chooser. No message is sent.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/chat.gif)

## [side-chat](side-chat/README.md)

![A real saved side conversation and its independent composer, using disposable fixture state.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/side-chat.gif)

## [documents](documents/README.md)

![Legacy local document editor, still retained until P2 migration. This is not the Barkpark Paper canvas.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/documents.gif)

## [settings](settings/README.md)

![Real Settings navigation. No server connection or credential is configured.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/settings.gif)

## [goals](goals/README.md)

![Goal component with explicitly injected fixture snapshots and providers blocked. Saved worker chats use the ordinary composer; this is not live scheduler/provider proof.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/goals.gif)

## [profiles](profiles/README.md)

![Profile Settings controls with injected stable registry names. This tour makes no profile switch; real switching and Paper save protection have separate integration evidence.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/profiles.gif)

## [adoption](adoption/README.md)

![Real recovery window with explicit fixture states; no migration is performed in this visual tour. Actual transaction/restart proof is separate.](runs/2026-09-23T22-51-45-914Z/adoption.gif)

## Dedicated journeys and remaining limits

The [Paper editor gallery](../images/status/manifest.json) records its own live server provenance. Dedicated journeys below retain their original source and review; this fixture approval does not restamp them or prove their remaining acceptance criteria.
