# Visual health

Approved fixture captures of the real Electron UI. No live provider, Paper-server save, migration or sync proof is implied. See [rules](RULES.md), [coverage](coverage.json) and the [review report](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/README.md).

Reviewed by Codex editor agent. E011: inspected all 40 deterministic stills/diffs and all 40 decoded GIF frames. Settings bundle SHA change to c73a0f46 is expected; geometry unchanged. Both real fallback compatibility runs separately prove actual upload/Undo/Redo/save/reload against a544 and545 servers. No new clipping or unintended displacement observed; deterministic tours are not server proof.

Source commit: cc17fcafd9868c0d8b65a99855f4f14992dce5e5; platform: win32; Electron: 38.8.6. Source fingerprints, including dirty capture inputs, are recorded in the manifest.

## [workspace](workspace/README.md)

![Real desktop navigation with disposable local notes; no cloud or provider.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/workspace.gif)

## [chat](chat/README.md)

![Shared main composer: draft, provider chooser and model chooser. No message is sent.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/chat.gif)

## [side-chat](side-chat/README.md)

![A real saved side conversation and its independent composer, using disposable fixture state.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/side-chat.gif)

## [documents](documents/README.md)

![Legacy local document editor, still retained until P2 migration. This is not the Barkpark Paper canvas.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/documents.gif)

## [settings](settings/README.md)

![Real Settings navigation. No server connection or credential is configured.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/settings.gif)

## [goals](goals/README.md)

![Goal component with explicitly injected fixture snapshots and providers blocked. Saved worker chats use the ordinary composer; this is not live scheduler/provider proof.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/goals.gif)

## [profiles](profiles/README.md)

![Profile Settings controls with injected stable registry names. This tour makes no profile switch; real switching and Paper save protection have separate integration evidence.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/profiles.gif)

## [adoption](adoption/README.md)

![Real recovery window with explicit fixture states; no migration is performed in this visual tour. Actual transaction/restart proof is separate.](runs/2026-09-22T05-31-59-959Z/adoption.gif)

## Dedicated journeys and remaining limits

The [Paper editor gallery](../images/status/manifest.json) records its own live server provenance. Dedicated journeys below retain their original source and review; this fixture approval does not restamp them or prove their remaining acceptance criteria.
