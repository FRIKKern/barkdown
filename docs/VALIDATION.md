# Evidence and remaining proof

Baseline at the 2026-09-21 roadmap reset. Implementation evidence is separate from the pending journey gates in [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md). [Original concept validation](archive/2026-09-21-validation.md) is archived.

| Baseline | Evidence | Limits |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop shell and agent integration | App `npm test`: unit suites, 76 Electron checks, direct-edit, composer-history and side-chat UI checks passed during local-runtime delivery. | Some provider orchestration uses scripted clients; not a new live run of every provider. |
| Shared editor features | [EDITOR-PARITY.md](EDITOR-PARITY.md) records live comparisons and counts, including tables, media, IME, multi-block editing and large documents. Upstream branch `a5440345c`. | PR #19579 still open at reset; matrix contains partial/limited proof. No claim of all upstream gates passing. |
| Managed Windows local runtime | Barkdown `930fc2f`: `npm run test:local` passed actual private PostgreSQL/Barkpark startup, authenticated reads, crash recovery and restart. Expanded `local-barkpark-ui.live.mjs` passed editing through recovery, saved state after restart, Settings status, quit/window-close cleanup. | Built checkout/toolchain required. Injected worker-failure log detection is unit-tested; actual OS error 487 is not deterministically reproduced. No packaged install or multi-profile proof. |
| Repository and screenshots | Root `npm run verify` passed; status image manifest at `5c91d29`. | Concept/build checks are not production storage or sync tests. |

## Pending evidence

P1–P5 are pending in [plan.json](plan.json). Existing implementation is the starting point; resetting the roadmap neither invalidates passing tests nor grants the new stages a pass. G1/G2 remain separate release gates.

## Commands

```sh
npm run plan
npm run verify
cd app
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:local
npm run test:parity
```

Run only relevant live suites with their actual prerequisites. `test:local` uses isolated temporary Windows clusters and a built checkout (see [runtime setup](LOCAL-BARKPARK.md)); `test:parity` uses a deliberately selected Barkpark/CLI target. Never silently switch or stop a shared service to make a test run. New installations use locked dependencies (`npm ci`) and Playwright Chromium. App source changes retain the commit → `npm run shots` → evidence commit workflow.

## Stage evidence ledger

Append a record when a slice lands: stage/scenario, exact source commits, command and outcome, artifact links, and limitations. Link the record from `plan.json` when completing a stage. Mark failures and partial proof explicitly; keep historical results with their tested baseline.
